# phpdatastore
PHP Data Storage solution.

PHP Datastore it’s a prototype for a file based storage solution. Like a database, you can store any data, index it and retrieve it any moment. As well you can delete, edit and version it. Using concepts from NoSQL and RDBMS, you can use PHP Datastore as a lightweight solution when you don’t want to depend from a database, but have the power of store and retrieve.
